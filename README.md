Math-based program used to print the multiplication table for a given number and double the value of a given number.
I was able to design a menu with appropriate user interactions and checks for valid entry.
I could have taken more time to write code that is more efficient to avoid the bugs I had to fix.
It was difficult writing code to output the multiplication table for a given number. I'm taking advantage of outside reading and tutors, and practice.
Creating menus and performing mathematical calculations, as well as printing tables are skills that are transferable to other coursework and projects.
I made sure provide appropriate comments alongside the written code.
